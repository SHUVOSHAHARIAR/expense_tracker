Project: Personal Expense Tracker For University Project
We are doing this project with 2 members (Shahariar Mahmud Shuvo and Rubait Miah)

The Personal Expense Tracker helps users track their daily expenses and visualize their spending habits through a simple command-line interface or a web application.
Below We are giving some description of the project - 
User Authentication: Allow users to create an account and log in.
Add Expenses: Users can add expenses with categories (e.g., food, transport, entertainment).
View Expenses: Display a list of expenses, filter by category or date.
Generate Reports: Create monthly/weekly reports summarizing expenses.
Data Visualization: Use libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to visualize spending habits.
Save Data: Store user data in a CSV file or a SQLite database.
Tech Stack
Python: Core language for the project.
Flask: For creating a web interface (optional).
SQLite: For database management (or CSV files for simplicity).
Matplotlib/Plotly: For data visualization.

Below we are providing a Project Structure --

expense_tracker/
app.py                Main application file
 models.py             Database models
 database.py           Database handling
expense.py           Expense management functions
 reports.py            Report generation
requirements.txt     Project dependencies
 README.md            Project documentation


Below we are writing the code for better understanding-  

This is the main application file where users can interact with the expense tracker ---  and it should be in app.py

import csv
from expense import add_expense, view_expenses, generate_report

def main():
    while True:
        print("\nPersonal Expense Tracker")
        print("1. Add Expense")
        print("2. View Expenses")
        print("3. Generate Report")
        print("4. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Choose an option: ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            category = input("Enter the expense category: ")
            amount = float(input("Enter the expense amount: "))
            add_expense(category, amount)
            print("Expense added!")
        elif choice == '2':
            view_expenses()
        elif choice == '3':
            generate_report()
        elif choice == '4':
            print("Exiting the program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid option. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


Next we are doing code for expense.py


import csv
from datetime import datetime

EXPENSE_FILE = 'expenses.csv'

def add_expense(category, amount):
    with open(EXPENSE_FILE, mode='a', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow([datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'), category, amount])

def view_expenses():
    try:
        with open(EXPENSE_FILE, mode='r') as file:
            reader = csv.reader(file)
            print("\nExpenses:")
            for row in reader:
                print(f"Date: {row[0]}, Category: {row[1]}, Amount: ${row[2]}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No expenses recorded yet.")

def generate_report():
    try:
        with open(EXPENSE_FILE, mode='r') as file:
            reader = csv.reader(file)
            total = 0
            print("\nExpense Report:")
            for row in reader:
                total += float(row[2])
            print(f"Total Expenses: ${total}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No expenses recorded yet.")
